# Poker project
This project was part of a task in the Artificial Intelligence course at Halmstad University, Sweden.\n
It consisted of designing an agent to play poker, where the goal is to win as much money as possible.\n
This project was developed in collaboration with my colleague [Ema Krcic](https://github.com/emakrcic16).
